I2C_EguardSimple.py:
   - reads I2C calibration data
   - checks checksum
   - computes gain and offset
   - writes gain and offset
   - numbers need for 0V and 1V need to be written before this routine

   - reads ADCs
   - Does not use Calibration

scratchpad.py:
   - misc copy space

TimeSerNum.py:
   - looks at current time
   - Checks to see if date/time is correct
